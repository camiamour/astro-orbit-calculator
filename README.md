# Astro Orbital calculator
A C++ program built by **Camila Torres**, an astrophysics student at Pasadena City College.  
This project calculates core orbital mechanics values for any planet or star, including:

- Circular orbit velocity, period, and escape velocity  
- Hohmann transfer Δv between two circular orbits  
- Synchronous orbit altitude (for geostationary-type orbits)  

**Built with:** C++ (CS 001 course foundations)  
**Applications:** Club outreach demos, astrophysics self-study, and research preparation.  
**Motivation:** Created as part of my ongoing self-guided learning for research internships at  
Carnegie Observatories and NASA JPL.  

> “I wanted to bridge the math I learned in physics and calculus with code and create a project that mixes scientific knowledge with creative direction*.”
